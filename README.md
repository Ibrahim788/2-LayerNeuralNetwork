# 2-LayerNeuralNetwork
#### A 2-Layer neural network built using Numpy as the sole dependency to perform Linear Algebra as well as Matplotlib for visualizing the datasets

#### The datasets used in this example come from SciKit Learns library of datasets. One can easily change the preprocessing step in order to utilize this shallow neural network on a new dataset.
